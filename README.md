    :wave: I'm a systems developer engineer who is passionate about making open-source more accesible. I investivate and collaborate with different
    <br>open-source projects to learn new ways of working and new techniques for development. To me, this is one of the ways to be able to spread a
    <br>culture of collaboration, learning and fun.

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup) and GraphQL. I recently was selected to be an inaugural <a href="https://stars.github.com/">GitHub Star 🌟</a> based on my involvement in the tech community.  My interest in the React ecosystem led me to launch <a href="https://www.meetup.com/React-Ladies/">React Ladies</a>, a community for women and non-binary ReactJS developers.
